# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

<h3>
AVG Moving react - drei to quarantine issue 
</h3>
I was creating a website using react, with @react-three drei.js, hence, it was blocked as a trojan from AVG. I dont know why the module is labelled as a trojan, but it is essential to use for further development of my react app. So i am gonna mark this as a false Positive and continue using it in my project. Would still appreciate further information from your labs.
